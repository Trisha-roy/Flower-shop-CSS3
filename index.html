                <p class="banner-desc">A flower shop is a business or retail outlet that primarily sells flowers. In most cases, the owner of the flower shop does not sell the flowers directly to consumers; instead, the shop's staff prepare bouquets that are sold to consumers by wholesalers, chain stores, grocers, and other retailers. Some flower shops offer telephone service, while others have an Internet presence. Flower shops sell flowers grown on farms and other wholesale operations, as well as flowers made from non-living materials like silk or plastic.</p>
